This Guide written in Jan 2021, and is meant to be used on a fresh install of the 32bit Raspberry Pi OS Desktop, on a Raspberry Pi 4.  

During Raspberry Pi OS Installation,
Choose Auto login, choose a password, and do anything else it asks for.

Connect to the internet the usual way and then open a Terminal and update.

sudo apt update
# The '-y' automatically chooses 'yes' during package installation. We'll use it in this project to make things quicker, but be careful with this flag when installing things.
sudo apt full-upgrade -y

After you are connected to the internet and have a web browser, I would recommend git cloneing this guide or bookmarking this page in your browser, so you'll have easy access to these instructions.

Use a Terminal to install snapd and retroarch:

sudo apt install snapd -y
sudo snap install retroarch
sudo apt install vim -y

Enable exfat.  This is optional.  I like using an exfat external thumbdrive to store the Games.  I chose Exfat because it works on all OS's.
sudo apt install exfat-fuse -y

Optional Argon One case shutdown script:
# https://github.com/okunze/Argon40-ArgonOne-Script
# Skip this if you don't have an Argon One Raspberry Pi 4 case.
curl https://download.argon40.com/argon1.sh | bash

Desktop Menu > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > Display 
   # fixes emulation display issues
   > Composite Video [Disable]
   # this is optional, use this if your screen does something annoying when the screen loses signal.
   > Screen Blanking [Disable]

# fixme! not sure yet if I need this, default may be fine.
Menu > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > Performance > GPU Memory > [128]

# Click OK, when done, and you will now be asked to reboot or you can type this into terminal to reboot:
sudo reboot

This is optional but if you chose to disable screen blanking, you may need a screen saver installed.  In a Terminal:

sudo apt install xscreensaver -y

I had to restart to use the screen saver program.

sudo reboot

Set the screensaver up by opening the program in:
Menu > Preferences > Screensaver

Configure Retroarch!

The default set of downloadable cores are ok, but the Playstation core isn't the best, since it only offers lower resolutins.  
To fix this we need to open a terminal and edit this file and change the URL:
The '427' may be a different number for you.  Also, use your favorite editor instead of vim.
vim snap/retroarch/427/.config/retroarch/retroarch.cfg
Find the line that starts with:
core_updater_buildbot_cores_url=
and change that URL to:
https://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/linux/armv7-neon-hf/latest/
Also, there are other URL's you can use, if you'd like to experiment with an older set of cores. Go to that URL in a web browser and browse around!
----------
#Start retroarch in fullscreen:
retroarch -f

#install your favorite editor
sudo apt install vim -y

Configure Retroarch. This first run will be slow.
retroarch

Change to XMB in retroarch
Settings > Drivers > Menu > [xmb]
Restart Retroarch

Now you should be using XMB.  Lets do some more things in Retroarch.

If you'd like to go ahead and go full screen, press 'f'

Hopefully your controller is mostly working, so you should be able to use that now, or you can just use the keyboards up
down left right and enter keys to get around in XMB.  If your controller isn't working go to:
Gear Icon(settings) > input > Port 1 controls > Set All Controls
You may have to do this a couple times if you mess up, so don't forget you do have the keyboard if you lose control with your controller.

If you have a spare button on your controller you may want to asign a hotkey that will pop up the XMB during gameplay:
Settings > Input > Hotkeys > Hotkey Enable

This is optional and you can come back to this later, but if you would like to swap the OK and Cancel buttons:
Settings(Second icon from the left) > input > menu controls > Menu Swap OK and Cancel Buttons [on]



Main Menu(First Icon from the left) Online Updater -> Update Assets

Main Menu > Online Updater -> Core Downloader > [choose cores here to download]

My current favorite cores are: 
snes9x current
fcemmu
pcsx

Big Plus Icon > Scan Directory > [choose rom directory]
Gear Icon > input > menu controls > Hotkeys > Menu Toggle Gamepad Combo > [start + select]
IF you have an extra button on your controller like on the 8bitdo, have a dedicated hotkey:
Gear Icon > input > menu controls > Hotkeys > Hotkey Enable > [choose the button for hotkey]
gear icon > video > scaling > integer scale > [on]
gear icon > video > 
	vertical sync [on]
	vertical sync swap int [1]
	frame delay [0]
	hard gpu [off]
	synct to exact [off]
gear icon > video > black frame insertion > [off]
















sudo raspi-config
system options > audio [select hdmi if needed]
xx display > composite video > v1 enable 4k60
display > screen blanking > [off]
xx performance > gpu memory > [128]
xx advanced options > gl > [gl fake kms]
advanced options > compositer > [no]





auto backup script
my_date=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')
cd /media/pi/LAKKA/rasp_pi_retroarch_conf_backups/
cp -r "/home/pi/snap/retroarch/427/.config/retroarch" "retroarch_$my_date"


autostart the script
In my scripts folder there is a pi_gaming dir.  This is not exact instructions.


If you break something and need a terminal only, after it boots to desktop, you can press ctrl + alt and then F1(or F2, F3...) F7 is the desktop

Audio headphone jack to low
In terminal type "alsamixer"
select the headphone jack, raise it up till you barely see red.
Press escape to exit.

Playstation Sound stutters
Play crash bandicoot
the first level you should eventually hear the stutters
Fix this by opening the menu, while game is running.
Options > Threaded Rendering > async





Does it bug you that sometimes your Pi will show a blank screen after a period of inactivity, which can only be undone by touching the keyboard? Use your editor of choice to modify /etc/rc.local and put the line setterm -blank 0 before the last line that says exit 0.

NES: FCEUmm.
Genesis: Genesis Plus GX. If you get slowdown, try PicoDrive.
32X: PicoDrive.
SNES: Snes9x Next. If you get slowdown, try CATSFC.

You're looking for es_swap_a_b = 1 found in /opt/retropie/configs/all/autoconf.cfg.
set R2 and L2 in the retroarch menu (do this after all other binds)

change to XMB in retroarch during a game playing (select + X)
  retroarch > [back button till at top of menu] settings > drivers > Menu > [xmb]

If you run into issues where things don't save:
Save that by Configuration
  retroarch > [back button till at top of menu] > configuration file > Save current 

if psx L2 and L2 still don't save, try these 1 at a time:
settings > configuration > save config on exit > [on]
settings > input > port 1 binds > save autoconfig

Also, if you want to turn off run ahead mode for only the psx, or maybe your tired of L2 and R2 not saving, you could try to:
settings > configuration > Use Global core options file > [off]


configs:

To have a core with different settings than the global settings:
While game is running, go to Overrides > save core config
Probably need to do this after every change.

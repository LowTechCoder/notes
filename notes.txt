Does it bug you that sometimes your Pi will show a blank screen after a period of inactivity, which can only be undone by touching the keyboard? Use your editor of choice to modify /etc/rc.local and put the line setterm -blank 0 before the last line that says exit 0.

NES: FCEUmm.
Genesis: Genesis Plus GX. If you get slowdown, try PicoDrive.
32X: PicoDrive.
SNES: Snes9x Next. If you get slowdown, try CATSFC.

change to XMB in retroarch during a game playing (select + X)

If you run into issues where things don't save:
Save that by Configuration

if psx L2 and L2 still don't save, try these 1 at a time:
settings > configuration > save config on exit > [on]

Also, if you want to turn off run ahead mode for only the psx, or maybe your tired of L2 and R2 not saving, you could try to:

To have a core with different settings than the global settings:
While game is running, go to Overrides > save core config
Probably need to do this after every change.

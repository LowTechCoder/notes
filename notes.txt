change to XMB in retroarch during a game playing (select + X)

If you run into issues where things don't save:

  retroarch > [back button till at top of menu] > configuration file > Save current 

if psx L2 and L2 still don't save, try these 1 at a time:

settings > input > port 1 binds > save autoconfig

Also, if you want to turn off run ahead mode for only the psx, or maybe your tired of L2 and R2 not saving, you could try to:
settings > configuration > Use Global core options file > [off]

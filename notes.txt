change to XMB in retroarch during a game playing (select + X)

If you run into issues where things don't save:
Save that by Configuration

if psx L2 and L2 still don't save, try these 1 at a time:

Also, if you want to turn off run ahead mode for only the psx, or maybe your tired of L2 and R2 not saving, you could try to:

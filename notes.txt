Set retroarch to fullscreen

While playing a game if you notice a little lag from the time you press a button and when the character on the game moves, then you may want to turn on Run Ahead Mode
Settings > Latency > Run-Ahead to Reduce Latency > [on]
Number of Frames to Run-Ahead > [1 or 2]
Use Second Instance for Run-Ahead > [off]

We could just exit RetroArch to save settings, but lets make sure the global file gets saved after making these changes.  Main Menu > Save Current Configuration

After turning Run-Ahead on globally, you'll need to turn it off for any console that can't handle it.  We'll use the Playstation as an example, and out of all the cores I use, this is the only one I need to turn off. This is also a good lesson on how to set settings for a single core, that will override the global settings you may set.

Sony - Playstation > Latency > Run-Ahead to Reduce Latency > [off]
Back button, Back button until you see Overrides close to the bottom of the list.  Select that and select Save Core Overrides to save those Run-Ahead settings only for the Playstation core.

Make sure your settings get saved on quit
Settings > Configuration > Save Configuration on Quit > [on]

If you break something and need a terminal only, after it boots to desktop, you can press ctrl + alt and then F1(or F2, F3...) F7 is the desktop



Playstation Sound stutters

Fix this by opening the menu, while game is running.

Does it bug you that sometimes your Pi will show a blank screen after a period of inactivity, which can only be undone by touching the keyboard? Use your editor of choice to modify /etc/rc.local and put the line setterm -blank 0 before the last line that says exit 0.

set R2 and L2 in the retroarch menu (do this after all other binds)

change to XMB in retroarch during a game playing (select + X)
  retroarch > [back button till at top of menu] settings > drivers > Menu > [xmb]

If you run into issues where things don't save:
Save that by Configuration
  retroarch > [back button till at top of menu] > configuration file > Save current 

if psx L2 and L2 still don't save, try these 1 at a time:
settings > configuration > save config on exit > [on]
settings > input > port 1 binds > save autoconfig

Also, if you want to turn off run ahead mode for only the psx, or maybe your tired of L2 and R2 not saving, you could try to:
settings > configuration > Use Global core options file > [off]

To have a core with different settings than the global settings:
While game is running, go to Overrides > save core config
Probably need to do this after every change.
